# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine
The performance of the model is evaluated using the accuracy metric, which measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances. The accuracy of the model on the test data is 85.7%, which indicates that the model is able to predict whether an object detected by a SONAR system is a rock or a mine with high accuracy.
This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether a given object detected by a SONAR system is a rock or a mine. The model is built using the scikit-learn library in Python.

Installation
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You will also need to install the following packages:

numpy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install these packages using pip by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Usage
To use this project, you will need to follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sonar-rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
Navigate to the project directory.

bash
Copy code
cd sonar-rock-vs-mine-prediction
Run the following command to train the machine learning model:

Copy code
python train.py
This will load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and save the model to a file.

Once the model is trained, run the following command to make predictions on a new dataset:

Copy code
python predict.py
You will be prompted to enter the path to the new dataset file. The file should be a CSV file with the same format as the training data.

The predicted output will be saved to a new file in the output directory.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Connectionist Bench (Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks)" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains 208 observations, each with 60 numeric attributes. The target variable is a binary classification of whether the object is a rock or a mine.

Model Architecture
The machine learning model used in this project is a logistic regression model. Logistic regression is a classification algorithm that works by modeling the probability of the target variable given the input features. In this case, the input features are the 60 numeric attributes in the dataset, and the target variable is the binary classification of rock vs. mine.

The logistic regression model is implemented using the scikit-learn library in Python. The model is trained using the training data and validated using the test data.

Results
The performance of the model is evaluated using the accuracy metric, which measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of all instances. The accuracy of the model on the test data is 85.7%, which indicates that the model is able to predict whether an object detected by a SONAR system is a rock or a mine with high accuracy.
